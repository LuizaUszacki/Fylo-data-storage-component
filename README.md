# Fylo data storage component

## About the Website
This website is a challenge from FrontEnd Mentors.
It's a data storage with hover effect in the button and an opacity animation when it loads.
It is responsive, changing the columns to rows depending on the screen's size, and was built using HMTL, Scss and a lit bit of JavaScript.
Besides, I also tried to make the website accessible using aria-label.

## Notes
Even if the challenge doesn't require JS, just CSS and HTML. I decided to use it to be able to active the input when clicking on the button.
I also decided to try to start using some animations and put the opacity animation when the website loads.
